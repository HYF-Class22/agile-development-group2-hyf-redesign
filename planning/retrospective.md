# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Stop overlooking detailed planning before starting a new feature.
- Stop relying too heavily on a single approach; consider exploring alternative
  solutions.

## Continue Doing

- Continue emphasizing effective communication within the team.
- Continue conducting regular code reviews to ensure code quality.
- Continue practicing iterative development to quickly adapt to changes.

## Start Doing

- Start incorporating more pair programming sessions to enhance collaboration.
- Start documenting best practices and lessons learned during the development
  process.
- Start exploring new tools that could improve the development workflow like
  live share on VSC

## Lessons Learned

- Analyze the impact of user feedback on the project and how it influenced
  decision-making.
- Reflect on the challenges faced during the project and document key takeaways.
- Discuss how different team members' strengths can be better utilized.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- The division of tasks among team members aligned well with their expertise,
  although we are still getting to know each other.
- Although the project setup and configuration went a little slowly at first, it
  eventually went well.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Communication breakdowns occurred during the first day and were resolved the
  next day.
- Unexpected technical challenges delayed the completion of certain features;
  for example, one of us could not share the screen during the meeting, but we
  were able to get along.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Additional ideas were introduced and adopted

### Or remove extra steps?

- Some initially planned features were deemed unnecessary and were removed from
  the scope.
